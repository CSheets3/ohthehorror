            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> This movie was electrifying! The plot is really
            the same as other zombie movies, but they way they deliver it...fantastic!
            <br>
            Plot Rating: 9 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> The characters were well carved out actually. At
            first I thought there was going to be too many characters, but they dwindled it down pretty quickly.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> This movie takes place everywhere. On a train, in the
            city for a moment. Really adventurous. The way they used to train was interesting too.
