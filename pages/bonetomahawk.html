            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> I usually don't like Wild West movies, because
            they're slow and drag the plot. This movie was quite different. It does have some slow development,
            but it sure delivers. This movie is absolutely brutal.

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson
            are legends. That's all that needs to be said.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> I didn't really notice anything out of place. 
            Some of the gory parts were wild and I appreciate that.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> Like I said earlier, Wild West movies aren't
            really my thing, but the setting of this movie is so...unsettling. It was dirty, gritty and raw.
            Defintely the best part about this movie.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> There's a serious lack of scoring in this
            movie which is why it felt slow. To be fair it did give you a sense of how alone you were
            when you were traveling back in these days.

            Solid movie. If you like Kurt Russell you will love this movie!
