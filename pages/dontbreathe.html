            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> I appreciate the newer idea it brought to horror,
            but I thought the plot could have been more detailed. There was a minor twist, but nothing that will
            throw you out of your seat.

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> Having 3 main characters really works for this
            movie because it did allow for some development. These 3 people come from different backgrounds and
            really expands on why they're robbing someone.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> Nothing too much. More of a movie that doesn't 
            rely on VFX; which is good.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> The setting was plain but very effective. It's a 
            robbery so it's expected to take place in a house.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> This was my favorite part of the movie really. 
            The way the plot is told, the movie needs to be quiet. The lack of scoring really helps you feel 
            anxious in this movie.

            This movie wasn't anything special. It was made well, with a cool idea, but didn't meet my expectations.
