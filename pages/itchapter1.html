            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> IT was amazing all around. The plot was well 
            explained and had a good cliff-hanger.
            <br>
            Plot Rating: 9 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> The characters are what really make this movie.
            You get to see how they develop as the movie goes on and everyone has their own personalities and problems.
            IT itself also well developed. You really get to know the methodology of IT and the reasoning behind
            it all.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> The VFX were amazing in this movie. Nothing was
            too wild and everything looked under control.

            VFX Rating: 9 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> Derry, Maine is where this story takes place and
            it serves its purpose well. If you are a fan of Stephen King then you would know that a lot of
            the creepy stories take place there.
            <br>
            Setting Rating: 9 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> Nothing too impressive about the scoring,
            but nothing bad about it either. The story was so compelling that I really didn't notice it.
            <br>
            Scoring Rating: 8 / 10

            I strongly recommend watching this movie. It's amazing and will keep you on the edge of your seat!
