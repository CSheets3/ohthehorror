            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> WOW. That's all I have to say. This movie
            was absolutely wild. The plot was so developed and left you hanging until the very end.
            The way the movie flows is just amazing. It's a slow burner but stunning!
            <br>

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> This movie has it all. These characters
            were so convincing! Everyone was so realistic and the plot really gave these characters life.
            The acting was phenomenal.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> The setting...fantastic. This whole movie is 
            creppy from start to finish. Esepecially the treehouse. All the props were set up so well and really
            drove the plot to completion.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The movie really didn't need scoring either.
            It was rather quiet and worked very well that way. Really gave you a small space feel.

            I'll be damned if this movie isn't an instant classic! Watch it immediately!
