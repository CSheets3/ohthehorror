            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> While the plot to The Witch is fairly simple, the execution is amazing.
            It takes place in New England in the 1630's. A family moves away from a small civilization due
            to religious conflicts. While they are living alone, strange events unfold that leads them to
            believe they are not alone.

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> The characters were actually well developed. As the movie continues
            they clash and start questioning each other's faith in order to explain what's happening to them.
            No characters were fillers and I believe they made rational decisions given the situation and
            time period.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> Not too much to say about this category. Everything looked well,
            the camerawork was great and there weren't any overdone parts.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> As mentioned before, it takes place in New England in the 1630's.
            The location was truly amazing as it gave the audience a visual to how isolated they were from
            the rest of society.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The scoring was amazing. There wasn't too much noise in the background
            and it makes you feel claustrophobic; making you feel more immersed into the setting. Overall, it was
            a quiet movie, which really helped with the tension.

        <p>
            I strongly recommend watching this movie!

            Side Note: I thought this movie was very well done, but you really have to be in the mood
            to watch it because it is easy to fall behind.
