            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> For being made in 1982, The Thing was amazing.
            It had a solid plot that places the characters in an isolated locating leaving them to deal with
            the events head on.
            <br>
            Plot Rating: 8 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> Overall, the characters were pretty good.
            There are a couple characters that are fillers, but everyone seems to have their place.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> This movie had fantastic FX. They were practical,
            and really gave the antagonist some life. Defintely made the movie that much better.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> A movie with this kind of plot and a setting
            taking place in Antartica really made this movie shine. I really liked how Antartica made them 
            isolated from society and you got a sense of lonliness because of it.
            <br>
            Setting Rating: 9 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The scoring was pretty generic, but it didn't
            get in the way with the rest of the movie.
            <br>
            Scoring Rating: 7 / 10

            For being made in 1982 this movie was wild. It's an instant classic a must see!
