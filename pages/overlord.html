            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> Very interesting plot and well developed.
            I didn't really expect anything great from this movie, but it was really fun to watch!

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> The characters were medicore. This movie
            was at its best when the action scenes occured. The only real form of development was the cliche
            good guy vs. bad guy situation. Nothing special.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> It did have some pretty sweet VFX added. I'd 
            say they're more realistic many of the movies now-a-days.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> I actualy enjoyed the setting. WW2 is very 
            interesting to me and this movie seemed to capture more of the 'behind the scenes' point of view
            during the war.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> Pretty generic, nothing special. Just kept
            the flow of movie going.

            Overlord was a refreshing movie to watch. It brought in some cool ideas and it's worth the watch.
