            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> The plot really blew me away. It was incredibly
            detailed with a lot of setups and payoffs. It takes place in the present day within a private community.
            This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat!

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> Each character had so much personality.
            It was filled with realistic dialogue and humor and they will leave you with goosebumps throughout
            the whole movie.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> There really wasn't any space for extra VFX. Which
            is great because then it feels authentic.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> It takes place in a wealthy, seculded neighborhood
            and you really feel the isolation as the movie continues rolling. This was a great place for the plot
            to develop.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The scoring was little out of the ordinary, but
            the movie was a different experience all together. The scoring definately set the tone for creepiness.
