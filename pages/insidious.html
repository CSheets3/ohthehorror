            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> This movie brings a fresh take on demon-horror.
            I wasn't expecting some of the twists and it's executed quite well.

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> The characters were well developed. This
            dark of a movie with a touch of comedy some of the characters bring mixed very well. The way that these
            charactes behave makes the situation very believeable and interesting.

            and nothing looked outrageous. Very pleasing to the eyes.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The movie was rather quiet and made you feel
            alone. It worked very well and when the scoring came in, it will fill you with dread and uneasiness.
