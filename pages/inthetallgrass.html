            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> The plot was really interesting. Although,
            nothing everything was explained the way it should have been. There was a few plot holes that
            left me confused. Overall, it wasn't executed very well.

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> The characters were pretty bland, nobody
            really had a personality and they were just there fill a role. There wasn't any clear line of thinking
            which is mildly understandable given the situation, but it could have been better.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> Nothing wrong with the VFX. Some of the grass was
            a little out of place, but nothing harsh.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> I really did enjoy the setting to this movie.
            It takes place in a pasture, isolated from society. The fact that they can make this setting fit the
            plot was a major plus.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The scoring was okay. There are a few
            chants to go along with it which really brings out the darkness in the movie.
            <br>
            Scoring Rating: 8 / 10

        </p>
        <p>
            The production value was great, but the movie fell short of my expectations.<br>
            If you like Stephen King then you may enjoy this movie more.
