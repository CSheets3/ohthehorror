            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> Very interesting plot. I thought it was well
            executed, but there were a few plot holes that were left unexplained. There was almost too much
            openess within it. Although it was a fresh take on horror and it performed well.

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> Everyone but the main characters were only okay.
            There wasn't really much development and it only seemed to revovle around one person. Which is fine, but 
            there were too many characters to take that route.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> Nothing really stood out as I don't think this
            movie needed that much. It was primarily used in the background gave the film a better setting.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> The setting was alright. They had some cool
            locations, like rafting down a river. Overall it fit well with the plot.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> Pretty generic, nothing special. Just kept
            the flow of movie going.

            This movie really wasn't suprising, but it wasn't that bad either. If you have the time I would watch it.
