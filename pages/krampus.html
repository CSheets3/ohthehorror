            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> Krampus is a great Christamas horror movie 
            to watch! It's dark but has some comedic relief that really pulls this plot together.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> You never really expect anything horrifying
            to happen on Christmas, but this movie performed well. The setting was light and happy while the 
            plot was dark and sinister.
