            <strong class="category-title">Plot:</strong><br> The fact that this movie is based on real events
            makes it so much better. The writers did a really good job setting up the plot so that the
            characters are forced into this haunting position.
            <br>
            Plot Rating: 8 / 10

            <strong class="category-title">Characters:</strong><br> Over the course of the movie you really
            start to feel for these characters. As a family, they're struggling financially, but can't move
            from their farmhouse. As a result, the characters become tightly connected as they try to survive
            the haunting. I think they all played their role exceptionally well and reacted accordingly.

            <strong class="category-title">VFX:</strong><br> Overall, the VFX were nice. It wasn't over done and 
            things looked practical.

            <strong class="category-title">Setting:</strong><br> It takes place in 1971 where Ed and Lorraine Warren
            investiagte one of their final cases. This creepy farmhouse will give you shivers all movie long. The
            house feels very authentic and you're naturally drawn to it.

            <strong class="category-title">Scoring:</strong><br> The scoring was good for the most part. There
            was some background noise, but usually it was so faint that you couldn't hear it unless you had headphones on.

            This movie was, hands down, one of the creepiest films I've seen recently!
